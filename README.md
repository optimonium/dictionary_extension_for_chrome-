# dictionary_extension_for_chrome-
# I created this because whenever I read an article and come across a word I don't know, I have to right click > search google > and sometimes type define 
# in order to find the definition of the word. Usually, I also go off track and start googling random things. So a dictionary extension will make it easier to 
# look up words without wasting time, going off task, and it's overall just more productive.
